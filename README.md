# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Credit card fraud detection is a process of identifying and preventing fraudulent credit card transactions. This is done by analyzing a variety of data points, such as the amount of the transaction, the time of the transaction, the location of the transaction, and the cardholder's history.

The goal of credit card fraud detection is to minimize the financial losses that are incurred by credit card companies and their customers. Fraudulent transactions can cost millions of dollars each year, so it is important to have effective fraud detection systems in place.

There are a number of different methods that can be used for credit card fraud detection. Some of the most common methods include:

- Statistical methods: These methods use statistical algorithms to identify patterns that are associated with fraudulent transactions.
- Machine learning methods: These methods use machine learning algorithms to learn from historical data and identify fraudulent transactions.
- Anomaly detection methods: These methods identify transactions that are outside of the normal range of activity.

The best method for credit card fraud detection will vary depending on the specific needs of the credit card company. However, all of the methods mentioned above can be effective in preventing fraudulent transactions.
